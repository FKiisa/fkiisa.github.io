Here's my shot at the task.

## About project

Project contains various API calls to `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/`, it fetches user information, album information, photos and everything else. Project is responsive, and should work on all devices. All routes are dynamic, all CTA buttons have undo functionality added to them, so when the user mistakingly does something, it can be restored. All actions also add an entry to the event log, which can be opened when clicked on the "activity log" section.
